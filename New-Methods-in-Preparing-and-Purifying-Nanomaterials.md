# Boron Nitride Nanosheets Webinar Summary

## Summary

New method for separating h-BN (white graphite) into boron nitride nanosheets. The sheets have desired features such as high temperature stability (900**째**C air/ 2000째C inert), it forms strong polymer bonds with the sheets having high mechanical strength (50x stronger than carbon fibre) making it good for reinforcement, it has high electrical and thermal resistance and absorbs radiation. These features making it useful for many applications.
